## The hotel

The Hotel Haffhus in the seaside resort of Ueckermünde, with its 76 rooms, restaurant, spa, bowling and various services from bicycle rental to charging stations for electric cars, is a typically owner-managed family business with a large tourist focus, as there are many of its kind not only in Germany. Using technology and digitization to optimize processes has always been an important component.

## Focus on digitization

Over the years, many digital services have been implemented or further developed to improve the customer journey. Today there are several messenger services from web chat to Google Business Chat that guests can use for simple communication. Dialogshift offers a user interface for this in which all messenger services come together. Pre-check-in, digital guest directory and electronic thermostats come from Betterspace, and there are two user interfaces for their administration. To optimize internal processes, the Haffhus Hotelkit also uses another browser window with a separate user interface to keep an eye on the important things. Last but not least, from time to time you also need access to your channel manager, the most important OTAs, voucher partners, tour operators and especially in Haffhus there is also energy monitoring and an important extranet access for online bookings of various services.

## The problem

The fact that you now and then also need access to your payment service provider, or Amazon, PayPal and some other portals for shopping, does not always simplify the matter of making the right access available for the right employee and preferably at the same time via every action to be informed. This situation has been annoying Dirk Klein, manager for sustainability and digitization at Haffhus, for a long time.

We have slowly come to a point where things are difficult to control and we are doing a lot more work than necessary due to the lack of interfaces between the systems.

That was also the reason why the Haffhus used the time of the pandemic to rethink its tech stack. The problems of the missing interfaces could be eliminated by switching to PMS and POS systems with a first API approach. Now you are able, if not already available, to develop your own interfaces for the integration of and into other systems. And in order to find information in one place and to be able to merge the many systems via one user interface, the step to digital-hotel was the logical way.

It's just nice to be able to have a quiet drink in the café and have everything in view. This calms down, relaxes and creates security for employees and management

"I would like some of my colleagues to take this step too, so in future we will have more time to talk to each other over a cup of coffee," added Dirk Klein.
