      question: "Do I still need a hotel program at all?",
      answer: "Yes. Your hotel software is an expert program. Here you maintain your prices and save many important basic settings. For most of the work at the reception, however, it is not necessary to use your expert program. Here you can use our assistants, for example, who guarantee that data is stored correctly in your hotel program without having to be a professional."

      question: "Can I access important data from my POS system?",
      answer: "There are now many POS manufacturers who allow access to this data via their interfaces. A lot is possible, from managing the menu to using guest data to daily reports for management. Just tell us what you want and we will tell you whether the software you are using can meet your needs."

      question: "What does single login mean?",
      answer: "A wide variety of software systems are used in most hotels. Each system not only needs its own browser window but also its own password. We not only manage all passwords with us, but give you access to the most important data of your other software used with just one login, as soon as it is already connected to us via an interface."

    {
      question: "How can I automate processes?",
      answer: "By collecting data from different systems and managing it centrally, we can help you make better decisions and even automate them. If, for example, guests are still checked in by reception at short notice, this information can automatically be passed on to housekeeping and the kitchen and service team receive an updated list of the breakfast guests for the coming day."
